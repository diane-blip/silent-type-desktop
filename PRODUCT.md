# Silent Type

<!-- impeccable:product-schema 1 -->

## Platform

Windows desktop, Python 3.12, Tk/ttk and pystray. No web service.

## Users and purpose

People who want to enter text by silently mouthing words at a webcam. Developers can inspect, adapt and contribute to the application.

Hold two modifier keys, wait for capture, mouth a phrase, and release. Local Auto-AVSR recognition produces text; recovery history is saved before guarded Unicode insertion into the original foreground window. The model is experimental and can misrecognize words.

## Confirmed release requirements

Public GitHub source and download on the author's personal profile, separate from private installation history. Attribution to Lipflow's inspiration and Auto-AVSR's recognition is required. No claim that the author invented silent typing or that Windows support is unique.

Preserve camera release, tray on/off, manual review, Recents copying, nonactivating status and cancellation. No microphone capture or saved video. Cloud punctuation is opt-in. Default storage and shortcuts must not overwrite older installations.

The user requested neutral grays, black and white, with restrained blue or teal, without SRC branding. Existing native desktop interactions and the locally rendered shushing icon are retained. No new visual concept or website is in scope.

## Quality boundaries

Review failure paths and privacy as well as successful use. Tests must prove behavior, not only source strings. Do not promise perfect code, measured lip-reading accuracy, full screen-reader support, universal app compatibility or a signed executable.

Model weights have separate unresolved terms and are not bundled or relicensed. No Chinese AI models are introduced. CPU and NVIDIA paths are distinct locked installations.
